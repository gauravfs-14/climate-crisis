## Project Structure

- `app/` - Next.js application routes and pages
- `components/` - Reusable React components
- `public/` - Static assets
- `lib/` - Utility functions and data processing
- `data/` - Static data files

## Development

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
